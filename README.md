A mod for The Long Dark which makes previously undroppable items removable from the inventory, as well as giving them proper weight.

This mod gives the camera, respirator and handheld shortwave the option to drop them from the inventory, as well as giving them proper weight. It also makes the bolt cutters visible in inventory, gives them weight and makes them removable.

Each item has a somewhat realistic and balanced amount of weight assigned:
- Bolt Cutters: 2KG
- Respirator: 0.75KG
- Camera: 0.3KG
- Shortwave: 0.1 KG

# Installation
- Download and drop the .dll file into your mods folder.
